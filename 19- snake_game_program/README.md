# 🐍 Snake Game

A classic **Snake Game** built in Python using the Turtle Graphics module.  
This project was originally created for learning purposes and has now been completed as a fully playable version.

## Overview
The player controls a snake that moves around the screen eating food.  
Each time the snake eats, it grows longer and the score increases.  
The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or with its own body.

## 🧠 Objectives Achieved
- Strengthened understanding of **Python fundamentals**  
- Practiced **loops**, **control flow**, and **object-oriented programming**  
- Implemented **event handling** with keyboard inputs  
- Built a functional **game loop** with screen updates  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**  
- **Turtle Graphics** (for graphics and movement)  
- **Random module** (for food placement)

## 🎮 Features
- Smooth snake movement  
- Real-time score display  
- Random food generation  
- Collision detection (walls and self)  
- Game over screen  
- Simple and responsive controls  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure **Python 3** is installed on your computer.  
2. Clone or download this repository.  
3. Run the main file using the command below:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ``` 
   

## 🚀 Control Commands
Use the arrow keys to move the snake:

- ⬆️ Up
- ⬇️ Down
- ⬅️ Left
- ➡️ Right

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Add sound effects
- Implement increasing speed or difficulty levels
- Create a restart menu or main screen
- Improve visual design (colors, borders, etc.)
