# Turtle Race üê¢

A simple Python turtle race game where the user can bet on which turtle will win. The turtles move forward randomly until one crosses the finish line.

## Features

- Users can place a bet on a turtle color.
- **Make sure to type the color exactly as shown** when placing your bet (e.g., "red", "blue").
- Randomized movement creates a unique race every time.
- Visual race using Python's Turtle graphics.
- Finish line displayed for clear race end.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Install `turtle` module (usually included in standard Python).
3. Run the script:

```bash
python turtle_race.py
```

4. Enter your bet when prompted and watch the race.

## How it Works

- Multiple turtles are created and assigned unique colors.
- A finish line is drawn on the screen.
- Each turtle moves forward a random number of steps in a loop.
- The race ends when one turtle crosses the finish line, and the result is displayed in the console (or on the screen if you added a message turtle).
