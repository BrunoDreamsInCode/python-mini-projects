# Auction Bidding Program

> Exercise from my current Python course. (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

Python exercise focused on learning:

- input() and user interaction
- Using dictionaries to store key-value pairs
- while loops to control program flow
- Iterating through dictionaries with for loops
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Functions to organize code and reuse logic

## Description

This program simulates a simple auction system:

- Users enter their name and bid amount
- Program stores the bids in a dictionary
- Users can continue to add new bidders until no one else wants to participate
- The program finds and announces the highest bidder and their bid

### Example interaction:

What is your name?: Bruno  
What is your bid?: $120  
Are there any other bidders? Type yes or no: yes  

What is your name?: Luana  
What is your bid?: $150  
Are there any other bidders? Type yes or no: no  

The winner is Luana with a bid of $150

Each run can have different bidders and bid amounts.

### Learning Goal

- Practice using dictionaries to store and access data
- Learn how to iterate through dictionary items
- Understand the use of while loops for continuous input
- Learn to write functions to find the highest value in a dataset
- Combine user input, logic, and data structures to solve a real-world problem

## How to Run
