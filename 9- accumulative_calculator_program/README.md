# Accumulative Calculator

> Simple Python calculator exercise from the Python course (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

Python exercise focused on learning:

* input() and user interaction
* Loops and control flow (while)
* Functions and modular code design
* Using dictionaries to store functions
* Handling user choices and dynamic operations

## Description

Performs basic arithmetic operations between two numbers. This calculator allows:

* Functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* A dictionary to store operations as values and call them dynamically
* A loop that allows continuing calculations with the previous result
* Logo displayed at the start of the program
* Continuous calculations without restarting the program

## Features

1. Choose operation: `+`, `-`,` *`,` /`
2. Input numbers: any floating point numbers
3. Continue calculations using the previous result
4. Start a new calculation at any time
5. Supports basic error handling (division by zero could be added)

## Learning Goals

* Practice modular programming with functions
* Use dictionaries to store and call functions dynamically
* Understand loops for repeated user interactions
* Learn to structure a simple interactive program
* Build a foundation for more complex calculators

## How to Run
