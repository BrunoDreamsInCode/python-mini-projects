A simple Python program created as part of a Python learning course. It draws geometric shapes from triangle to nonagon using the `turtle` module. Each shape is drawn with a random color and uses a turtle cursor for visualization.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Run the script in your terminal or IDE:

```bash
