# Higher Lower Game

> Exercise from my current Python course. (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

This repository contains two versions of the same exercise:

- **v1_higher_lower.py** â€“ My first implementation, done **without looking at the instructor's solution**.  
- **v2_higher_lower.py** â€“ Refactored version, done **after reviewing the instructor's solution and reflecting**. I rewrote it **based on my understanding**, applying the concepts in practice rather than copying.

Python exercise focused on learning:

- `input()` and user interaction  
- Loops and iteration  
- Working with lists and dictionaries  
- Random selection with `random.choice()` and `random.randint()`  
- Using functions to organize code  
- Conditional statements and logic for comparisons  
- Clearing the console in a cross-environment way  

## Description

A game where the player guesses which account has more followers:

- Compare two accounts at a time (A vs B)  
- Each account includes **name**, **description**, **country**, and **follower count**  
- Program keeps track of the player's **score** for consecutive correct guesses  
- The next round presents a new comparison, with B becoming A if guessed correctly  
- Visual ASCII art (`logo` and `vs`) enhances user experience  

### Example output:

Compare A: Instagram, a Social media platform, from United States.  
VS  
Against B: Cristiano Ronaldo, a Footballer, from Portugal.  

Who has more followers? Type 'A' or 'B': a  
ðŸŽ‰ You're right! ðŸŽ‰ Current score: 1.  

Compare A: Instagram, a Social media platform, from United States.  
VS  
Against B: Dwayne Johnson, an Actor, from United States.  

Who has more followers? Type 'A' or 'B': b  
ðŸŽ‰ You're right! ðŸŽ‰ Current score: 2.  

...  
Sorry, that's wrong. Final score: 3  

Each run generates a new sequence of comparisons, keeping the game unpredictable and challenging.

### Learning Goals

- Practice using randomization in Python  
- Work with lists and dictionaries to store and retrieve data  
- Combine loops, conditions, and functions to build a small interactive program  
- Improve console-based user interface skills  
- Reinforce understanding by **rewriting code after reviewing a reference solution**

## How to Run

```bash
python v1_higher_lower.py  # First version
python v2_higher_lower.py  # Refactored version
