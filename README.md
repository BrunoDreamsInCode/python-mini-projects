# Python Exercises Collection

> A growing collection of Python exercises as I progress through my learning journey.

## About

This repository hosts **all Python exercises** I complete during my studies and practice.  
Each exercise has its **own folder** with the code (`.py`) and a README explaining the exercise.  

The repository is **continuously updated** as I complete new exercises.  
The goal is to track my progress, improve my Python skills, and build a personal library of solved problems.

## Structure

```
<exercise_number>- <exercise_name>/
    ├─ <script>.py
    └─ README.md
.gitignore
```

- Each exercise folder contains all necessary files for that exercise.  
- `.gitignore` is included to avoid uploading unnecessary files like IDE configs or caches.

## How to Use

- Browse the exercises by folder.  
- Follow the instructions in each exercise’s README to run or test it.  
- New exercises will be added regularly as I continue learning.

## Goals

- Improve Python fundamentals and problem-solving skills  
- Practice good project organization and Git/GitHub workflow  
- Build a reference library of Python exercises
