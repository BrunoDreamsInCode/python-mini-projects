# Password Generator Program

> Exercise from my current Python course. (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

Python exercise focused on learning:

- `input()` and user interaction  
- `for` loops and iteration  
- Working with lists and `append()`  
- Random selection with `random.choice()`  
- Shuffling items with `random.shuffle()`  
- String manipulation using `"".join()`  

## Description

Generates a secure password based on user preferences:

- Choose how many **letters**, **symbols**, and **numbers** to include  
- Program randomly selects characters and builds a list  
- Final password is **shuffled** so it does not follow a predictable pattern  

### Example output:

Your final password: `x$d24g*f9`
Each run produces a new randomized password, with letters, numbers, and symbols in different positions. This makes the password much harder for hackers to crack.

### Learning Goal
Practice using randomization and shuffling in Python

Understand how to convert between lists and strings

Learn how to combine logic with randomness to solve real-world problems


## How to Run

```bash
python password_generator.py
