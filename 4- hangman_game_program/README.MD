# HANGMAN GAME 

> Exercice from my current Python course. (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)

Python exercise focused on learning:

- Input() user interaction
- conditional statements.
- loops (`while` and `for`)
- manipulation of (`strings`and `lists`)

This is a simple Hangman Game

-Randomly select a word from a list
-Player can guess typing the word
-Track remind lives
-Display progress with placeholder
-Give the results of Win or Lose

### How to Play
    1. Run the program
````bash
python hangman_game_program.py
    2. The game shows the word as underscores _ for each letter.
    3. Enter a letter when prompted.
    4. If the letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct positions.
    5. If the letter is not in the word, you lose a life.
    6. The game ends when:
    7. You guess all letters correctly → You WIN!
    8. You run out of lives → Game Over!
